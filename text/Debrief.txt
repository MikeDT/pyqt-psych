Thanks for taking part in the experiment.  You've been helping us explore the Ellsberg paradox and the ambiguity effect. So you have a reference point these were the historic findings:


When attempting to draw a ball of a specified colour either from an urn containing 50 red balls and 50 blue balls or from an
urn containing an unknown ratio of 100 red and blue balls, the majority of decision-makers prefer the known-risk urn, and this ambiguity
aversion effect violates expected utility theory. 


In an experimental investigation that Pullman and Colman performed in 2008 found the effect of urn size on ambiguity aversion, for 149 participants, was non-significant with levels of aversion when choosing from urns containing 2, 10, or 100 balls. 


The occurrence of a substantial and significant ambiguity aversion effect even in the smallest urn suggests that influential theoretical interpretations of ambiguity aversion may need to be reconsidered.
