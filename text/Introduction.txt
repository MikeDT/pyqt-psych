You've volunteered to participate in a psychology experiment with a rich history.  An area first explored by Ellsberg in 1961 it tackles our perception of risk and reward and the decisions we make when faced with differing degrees of uncertainty.

Specifically, this is a replica of the Pulford and Colman (2008) experiment, but within a computer programme.  Navigation of the test is just like a regular windows application, so when you're ready click next to progress to the disclaimer which you need to read and presuming you're comfortable with it provide consent.


Thanks for your participation!!
